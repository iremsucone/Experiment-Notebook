# Easy Experiment Notebook

A simple Python-based lab report automation tool! Developed by a systematic logging enthusiast, this tool generates structured and well-formatted reports in both PDF and DOCX formats. An ideal solution for researchers and lab personnel who need an easy way to document their experiments! :)
Below is a sample README for your GitHub repository:

## Features

**Interactive Input:**  
  The script prompts you to enter the following information:
  - **Experiment Title:** The name of your experiment.
  - **Experimenter Name:** The name of the person conducting the experiment.
  - **Project Name:** The associated project or research area.
  - **Chemicals Used:** List of chemicals and their respective amounts.
  - **Equipment Used:** List of equipment utilized during the experiment.
  - **Procedure:** Step-by-step instructions (these are automatically numbered in the final report).
  - **Observations:** Any observations noted during the experiment.
  - **Results:** The outcome or results from the experiment.

- **Report Generation:**  
  Once you enter the required details, the script generates:
  - A **PDF report** with a table-like structure displaying all experiment details.
  - A **DOCX report** with similar formatting and numbered procedure steps.

- **Logging:**  
  All experiments are logged to a JSON file (`experiment_log.json`), keeping a record of your past entries.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- [FPDF](https://pypi.org/project/fpdf/) (for generating PDF reports)
- [python-docx](https://pypi.org/project/python-docx/) (for generating DOCX reports)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install fpdf python-docx
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script:**

   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

2. **Follow the Prompts:**  
   When you run the script, you will be asked to provide:
   - **Experiment Title**
   - **Experimenter Name**
   - **Project Name**
   - **Chemicals Used:** Enter the chemical name and amount (press Enter without typing anything to finish).
   - **Equipment Used:** Enter each piece of equipment (press Enter without typing anything to finish).
   - **Procedure:** Enter each step (press Enter without typing anything to finish).
   - **Observations**
   - **Results**

3. **Output:**  
   After providing all the details, the script will generate:
   - A PDF report (e.g., `experiment_report_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.pdf`)
   - A DOCX report (e.g., `experiment_report_YYYYMMDDHHMMSS.docx`)

   Your experiment will also be logged in the `experiment_log.json` file.

## Example

Inside the folder, you'll find sample PDF and DOCX files that showcase the lab report generated by this script. These examples illustrate the format, layout, and table structures used in the report.
